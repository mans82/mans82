I'm Amir Hossein! I currently study Computer Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University. I love hacking into things, building awesome tools, automating tasks, Leetcoding, reading fiction (and sometimes non-fiction too), and sitting in front of my desk and staring at the monitor for hours long during the day.

You can reach me via [my email](mailto:cando428@gmail.com).
